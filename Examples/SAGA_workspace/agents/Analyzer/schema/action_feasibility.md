When evaluating "action_feasibility", consider these four key factors in order:

1. **Physical/Logical Constraints**: Can this action physically happen in the game world?
2. **Game System Rules**: Is this action supported by the game mechanics and rules?
3. **Character Capabilities**: Does this character have the ability to attempt this action?
4. **Situational Context**: Is this action appropriate given the current circumstances?

**FEASIBILITY LEVELS:**

**"possible"** - Standard actions with reasonable success chances:
- Action aligns with character abilities and current situation
- Standard dice roll determines success/failure
- No extreme constraints or unusual risks
- Examples: Combat with appropriate-level enemies, skill checks within character expertise, social interactions in normal circumstances

**"difficult"** - Technically possible but with significant constraints:
- Action pushes character limits or faces major obstacles
- High difficulty penalties or harsh failure consequences
- Requires exceptional luck or creativity to succeed
- Examples: Attempting actions far above character level, performing complex tasks while injured, social interactions with hostile or suspicious NPCs

**"impossible"** - Actions that cannot be performed:
- Violates physical laws or game world logic
- Exceeds character abilities by an unreasonable margin
- Contradicts established game rules or character limitations
- Examples: Non-magical characters casting spells, interacting with absent NPCs, performing actions requiring abilities the character doesn't possess

**DECISION PROCESS:**
1. First check if the action violates any absolute constraints (impossible)
2. Then assess if major obstacles exist but success is theoretically possible (difficult)  
3. If neither applies, default to possible with appropriate dice checks

**IMPORTANT:** Always explain your reasoning briefly. If marking as "difficult" or "impossible", the alternative_suggestion field should offer a modified approach that could work.
