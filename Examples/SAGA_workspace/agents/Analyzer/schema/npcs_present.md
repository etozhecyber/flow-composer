List all NPCs in current scene with sufficient detail to assess their potential impact on player actions, including situational awareness and relationship dynamics.

**ESSENTIAL INFORMATION:**

**Basic Identity:**
- Name and role/occupation in community
- Social status, authority level, or influence
- Current physical location within scene

**Current State:**
- What they're currently doing (conversation, work, observation)
- Level of attention paid to players and surroundings
- Emotional state (mood, stress level, alertness)
- Physical condition (health, intoxication, fatigue)

**Relationship to Players:**
- Recognition level (knows players, heard of them, strangers)
- Relationship history and previous interactions
- Current attitude (friendly, neutral, suspicious, hostile)

**Impact Factors:**
- Accessibility for conversation or approach
- Potential as witnesses to player actions
- Likelihood of intervention or reaction to events
- Influence over other NPCs or situation outcomes

**FORMAT OPTIONS:**
- **Simple**: ["NPC Name (Role/Current Activity)"]
- **Detailed**: ["NPC Name (Role) - current activity, attention level, relationship to players"]

**SITUATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:**
- **Covert Actions**: Who might notice unusual behavior or report suspicious activities?
- **Social Interactions**: Who holds influence, authority, or could mediate/escalate conflicts?
- **Combat/Danger**: Who might assist, interfere, or become collateral damage?

**QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- **Effective**: "Tavern keeper Baldur - wiping mugs behind bar, watching players with merchant's interest"
- **Avoid**: "Some people are around" / "Everyone loves the players" / Overwhelming lists without context

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- Include 2-6 NPCs typically (avoid overwhelming complexity)
- Mix different attention levels and relationship types
- Focus on NPCs who will impact the scene rather than pure atmosphere
- Consider both helpful and hindering presences
- Account for background NPCs when they matter to privacy/witnesses

**BALANCE PRINCIPLES:**
Adjust detail based on scene importance - major story moments deserve more detailed descriptions, but always include enough information for players to assess social/tactical implications of their actions.
