Define the most direct and immediate consequence of player's action. Answers "What did the player achieve?" or "What happened as direct result of their action?"

**CORE CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Directness**: Immediate, first-order consequence directly relating to player's intended goal
- **Specificity**: Concrete, measurable results with clear "what," "how much," and "how"
- **Centrality**: Single most important outcome, distinguished from side effects or secondary consequences

**SUCCESS LEVEL VARIATIONS:**
- **Critical Success**: Original goal achieved perfectly + significant bonus benefits exceeding expectations
- **Success**: Original intended goal achieved exactly as planned with complete, satisfactory outcome
- **Partial Success**: Only portion of goal achieved with limitations, incomplete or conditional outcomes
- **Failure**: Goal not achieved, desired outcome not obtained, resources/time spent without gain
- **Critical Failure**: Goal fails completely + situation becomes significantly worse, creates larger problems

**RESULT EXAMPLES BY CATEGORY:**
- **Information Gathering**: "Discovered exact artifact location" vs "Found partial clues" vs "No relevant information located"
- **Social Interaction**: "Secured full 1000 gold sponsorship" vs "Conditional 500 gold promise" vs "Request rejected"
- **Combat**: "Dealt 8 damage, severely wounding orc" vs "3 damage, orc remains threatening" vs "Attack missed"
- **Skill Usage**: "Successfully picked lock, door opens" vs "Lock loosened, one more attempt needed" vs "Pick attempt failed"

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- **DO**: Include specific numbers/quantities, focus on immediately verifiable outcomes, use clear language, provide information for planning next actions
- **DON'T**: Use vague descriptions, mention only future possibilities, mix primary results with side effects, write overly complex explanations

**PRIMARY RESULT vs SIDE EFFECTS:**
- **Primary Result**: Direct consequence of intended goal, immediate certain change, core action purpose
- **Side Effects**: Unintended additional results, indirect impacts, unexpected outcomes
- **Example**: "Restored 15 HP, returned to full health" (primary) vs "Magical fatigue, attracts monsters" (side effects)

**PRACTICAL APPLICATION:**
1. Write from player perspective: "What did I achieve?"
2. Make it measurable: specific numbers, items, information
3. Focus on immediate effects: what happens right now
4. Single outcome: choose most important result
