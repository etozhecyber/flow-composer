Define unintended additional consequences that result from player's action. These are secondary outcomes occurring alongside primary result but were not the player's main objective.

**CORE CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Unintended Nature**: Results player did not plan for, occurring as byproducts of main action
- **Indirect Consequences**: Second or third-order effects stemming from primary result or method used
- **Complexity Addition**: Elements that add new variables or influence future decision-making

**SUCCESS LEVEL VARIATIONS:**
- **Critical Success**: Mostly positive additional benefits, unexpected opportunities, reputation improvements
- **Success**: Generally neutral or mildly beneficial consequences, predictable secondary effects
- **Partial Success**: Mixed consequences (positive and negative), constraints or complications from incomplete success
- **Failure**: Primarily negative but not severe consequences, relationship deterioration, resource waste
- **Critical Failure**: Serious long-term negative consequences, difficult-to-repair damage, cascading disasters

**SIDE EFFECT CATEGORIES:**
- **Social**: Reputation changes, relationship shifts, social status alterations
- **Economic**: Unexpected costs/income, market influence, new business opportunities
- **Tactical/Strategic**: Information revelation, position exposure, resource state changes
- **Environmental**: Physical changes to space/structures, ecosystem impacts, weather alterations
- **Psychological**: Trauma/fear, confidence changes, motivation shifts

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- **Include 3-5 diverse side effects** from different categories
- **Make effects logically connected** to the action with believable cause-and-effect
- **Balance positive, negative, and neutral effects** appropriately for success level
- **Consider both immediate and delayed consequences**

**PRIMARY RESULT vs SIDE EFFECTS DISTINCTION:**
- **Primary Result**: "What did player achieve with intended goal?"
- **Side Effects**: "What else happened as result of this action?"

**Example:**
Action: "Cast explosive spell to destroy boulder"
Primary Result: "Boulder completely destroyed, path now clear"
Side Effects: ["Explosion noise attracts monsters", "Rock debris makes terrain treacherous", "Magical energy severely depleted"]

**AVOID:**
- Mixing primary results with side effects
- Effects unrelated to original action
- Consequences too severe for action level
- Only negative effects (unless critical failure)
