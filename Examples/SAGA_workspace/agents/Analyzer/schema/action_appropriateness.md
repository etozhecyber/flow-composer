Evaluate how well player's action fits current social, cultural, and situational context. Focus on "Is this the right thing to do in this situation?" separate from physical feasibility.

**ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:**

**Social Context:**
- Formality level (official ceremony vs casual gathering)
- Hierarchy and power dynamics (speaking to superiors vs peers)
- Public vs private setting (open square vs private room)
- Social expectations and etiquette for this situation type

**Cultural Background:**
- Religious customs and taboos
- Regional traditions and local customs
- Class consciousness and social stratification
- Gender roles and cultural expectations

**Relational Context:**
- Intimacy level with other characters (stranger vs close friend)
- Trust and reputation between parties
- History of past interactions and current emotional state

**Situational Timing:**
- Is this the right moment? (interrupting vs appropriate pause)
- Does current mood support this action?
- Is there urgency justifying unusual behavior?
- Are there competing priorities making this poorly timed?

**Character Consistency:**
- Does this match character's established personality and values?
- Would this character realistically choose this approach?

**APPROPRIATENESS LEVELS:**

**"appropriate"** - Natural fit for situation:
- Aligns with social expectations and context
- Matches character personality and background
- Likely to achieve desired outcome without negative side effects

**"questionable"** - Awkward but not completely wrong:
- Might achieve goal but will raise eyebrows
- Creates minor social friction or misunderstandings
- Shows poor situation reading but understandable motivation

**"inappropriate"** - Seriously mismatched to situation:
- Violates clear social norms or expectations
- Creates significant offense, suspicion, or hostility
- Contradicts character's established personality or values

**DECISION FRAMEWORK:**
1. Consider social "temperature" (formal/informal, tense/relaxed)
2. Assess power dynamics and relationship status
3. Check character personality and values alignment
4. Evaluate timing and contextual appropriateness
5. Consider potential consequences and reactions

**NOTE:** Even "inappropriate" actions can be justified by extreme circumstances. Always consider full context.
