Determine degree of success using 5-tier system that goes beyond simple pass/fail. Consider dice results, character abilities, difficulty, and situational modifiers.

**SUCCESS LEVELS:**

**"critical_success"** - Exceptional achievement beyond expectations:
- **Triggers**: Natural 20 rolls, very easy tasks with high abilities, extremely favorable circumstances
- **Effects**: Original goal achieved perfectly + unexpected bonus benefits
- **Example**: Information request → Desired info + secret intel + NPC becomes ally

**"success"** - Clean achievement of intended goal:
- **Triggers**: Dice roll clearly beats target, balanced difficulty vs ability, neutral/favorable conditions
- **Effects**: Original objective accomplished as planned without complications
- **Example**: Information request → Exact information obtained as expected

**"partial_success"** - Goal partially achieved with limitations:
- **Triggers**: Dice roll barely meets target, difficulty slightly exceeds ability, minor obstacles
- **Effects**: Some but not all objectives met, incomplete or conditional results
- **Example**: Information request → Some information gained, NPC wants additional payment for rest

**"failure"** - Goal not achieved without severe consequences:
- **Triggers**: Dice roll misses target, difficulty significantly exceeds ability, unfavorable conditions
- **Effects**: Original goal not accomplished, minor negative consequences
- **Example**: Information request → No information gained, NPC becomes suspicious

**"critical_failure"** - Catastrophic failure with serious complications:
- **Triggers**: Natural 1 rolls, extremely difficult tasks with low abilities, severely adverse circumstances
- **Effects**: Goal fails completely + unexpected serious problems created
- **Example**: Information request → No information + exposed as spy + guards called

**ASSESSMENT FACTORS:**
- **Dice Results**: Natural 20/1 are critical candidates; 15-19 success; 10-14 partial; 2-9 failure
- **Character Expertise**: Upgrade success in specialization areas, downgrade in unfamiliar areas
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Easy tasks upgrade results, very hard tasks downgrade results
- **Situational Modifiers**: Favorable conditions upgrade, adverse conditions downgrade

**IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:**
- Success level affects immediate results and future opportunities/relationships
- Critical results should have lasting campaign impact
- Partial success often creates more interesting story complications than clean success
- Balance dramatic moments - don't overuse critical results
