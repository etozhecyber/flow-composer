Define knowledge, facts, or intelligence that player discovers as result of their action. Represents previously unknown information that becomes available to inform future decisions and story progression.

**CORE CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Novelty**: Information player did not know before, filling knowledge gaps or correcting assumptions
- **Relevance**: Directly connected to current situation, goals, or ongoing story elements
- **Actionability**: Concrete, usable intelligence that can inform future actions rather than abstract knowledge

**SUCCESS LEVEL VARIATIONS:**
- **Critical Success**: Comprehensive detailed intelligence exceeding expectations, hidden secrets revealed, game-changing information
- **Success**: Clear, accurate information at requested level, practical reliable knowledge suitable for planning
- **Partial Success**: Incomplete or fragmentary intelligence, clues requiring additional investigation, uncertain information
- **Failure**: Usually no new information gained, discovery that existing information was incorrect
- **Critical Failure**: Unwanted intelligence creating disadvantages, information benefiting enemies or opposition

**INFORMATION CATEGORIES:**
- **Geographic**: Locations, routes, terrain features, hidden passages
- **Character**: NPC backgrounds, motivations, relationships, hidden identities
- **Organizational**: Power structures, political relationships, faction plans
- **Historical/Cultural**: Past events, legends with basis in fact, cultural customs
- **Technical/Magical**: How magic/technology functions, special materials, activation methods
- **Economic/Resource**: Valuable resource locations, trade routes, market opportunities
- **Tactical/Strategic**: Enemy plans, weaknesses, security systems, timing information

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- **Specificity**: Include concrete details (numbers, names, locations, timeframes), answer "when, where, who, what, how"
- **Practical Utility**: Information should be usable for planning future actions and influence decision-making
- **Appropriate Scope**: Match information depth to success level, balance revelation with maintaining mystery
- **World Consistency**: Align with established setting, maintain logical connections to existing story elements

**QUALITY EXAMPLES:**
- **Excellent**: "Village underground contains 100-year-old tunnel network with entrance in blacksmith's well, connects to castle but contains traps requiring thief skills"
- **Needs Improvement**: "Something important seems hidden somewhere" / "You learn everything about everyone"

**AVOID:**
- Information contradicting established facts
- Knowledge that trivializes upcoming challenges
- Details so minor they don't affect gameplay
- Intelligence serving only exposition without utility
