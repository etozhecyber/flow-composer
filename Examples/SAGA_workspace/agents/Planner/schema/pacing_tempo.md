Manage speed and rhythm of game progression to optimize player experience and storytelling effectiveness. Controls "how quickly events unfold" while tension_level measures "how urgent and important."

**CORE CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Speed and Rhythm**: Frequency of event occurrence, speed of information delivery, cycle of actions and reactions
- **Player Experience**: Amount of thinking time provided, type of immersion, participation style and concentration level
- **Storytelling Tool**: Method of dramatic effect creation, timing of information revelation

**DISTINCTION FROM TENSION LEVEL:**
- **Tension Level**: "How dangerous and important is this?" (stakes/urgency)  
- **Pacing Tempo**: "How quickly are things happening?" (speed/rhythm)

**THREE PACING TEMPOS:**

**"fast" - Rapid Tempo:**
- Quick succession of events requiring immediate responses
- Large amounts of information in short timeframes
- Dynamic, energetic progression
- Example: Chase scenes, emergency situations, rapid social dynamics

**"moderate" - Balanced Tempo:**
- Even-paced progression with adequate thinking time
- Steady information flow allowing for planning
- Natural conversation and interaction rhythms
- Example: Standard exploration, typical negotiations, balanced combat

**"slow" - Deliberate Tempo:**
- Leisurely, careful progression with focus on details
- Time for deep thought and thorough analysis
- Atmosphere and emotion immersion emphasis
- Example: Critical decisions, complex puzzles, emotional conversations, detailed investigation

**COMBINATION EXAMPLES:**
- High Tension + Fast Tempo: "Life-or-death chase sequence"
- High Tension + Slow Tempo: "Bomb defusal requiring careful precision"
- Low Tension + Fast Tempo: "Enjoyable party with energetic atmosphere"
- Low Tension + Slow Tempo: "Peaceful inn with comfortable leisure"

**SUCCESS LEVEL IMPACT:**
- **Critical Success**: Fast tempo creates cascading momentum; slow tempo savors success meaning
- **Critical Failure**: Fast tempo creates urgent crisis; slow tempo absorbs failure impact

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- **Situational Appropriateness**: Match tempo to scene nature, player state, and story flow
- **Balance and Variation**: Avoid monotonous tempo; pursue natural transitions
- **Purpose Consciousness**: Understand why this tempo is needed for intended player experience

**AVOID:**
- Maintaining same tempo throughout entire session
- Changing tempo without narrative justification
- Ignoring player energy and attention levels
- Using inappropriate tempo for situation type
