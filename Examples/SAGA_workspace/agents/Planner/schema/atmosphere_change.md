Define how the collective emotional climate and psychological tension shifts as a result of player action. Focus on scene-wide mood changes rather than individual reactions or physical alterations.

**CORE CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Emotional Dimension**: Changes in collective psychological state affecting everyone present
- **Collective Impact**: Scene-wide atmosphere, not individual NPC reactions
- **Persistence**: Lasting background conditions influencing subsequent interactions

**DISTINCTION FROM OTHER ELEMENTS:**
- **Scene Description**: "What happened and how it looks"
- **Atmosphere Change**: "How the emotional climate shifted"
- **Environmental Changes**: Physical alterations vs psychological alterations
- **NPC Reactions**: Individual responses vs overall mood current

**TYPES OF ATMOSPHERE CHANGES:**
- **Tension Shifts**: "Relaxed atmosphere sharpens into alert wariness" / "Taut silence melts into warm chatter"
- **Trust Changes**: "Initial skepticism transforms into respectful attention" / "Warm reception cools into guarded caution"
- **Power Dynamics**: "Perception shifts from 'ordinary visitor' to 'important figure'" / "Respectful attention dissolves into dismissive indifference"
- **Social Inclusion**: "Outsider status evaporates as group embraces you" / "Welcoming atmosphere turns exclusionary"

**SUCCESS LEVEL VARIATIONS:**
- **Critical Success**: Dramatic transformations with universal impact
- **Success**: Clear, positive improvements with stable new climate
- **Partial Success**: Mixed elements with incomplete shifts
- **Failure**: Deterioration or lack of desired improvement
- **Critical Failure**: Dramatic deterioration into hostility or danger

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- **Specify Concrete Emotions**: "Trust transforms into suspicion" not "atmosphere changes"
- **Express Directional Change**: Use "from â†’ to" format showing transformation
- **Emphasize Collective Impact**: "Everyone feels", "entire space becomes", "universal shift"
- **Indicate Scope**: Whether changes are temporary or lasting

**QUALITY EXAMPLES:**
- **Effective**: "Cautious business atmosphere evolves into enthusiastic partnership energy as mutual excitement replaces initial wariness"
- **Needs Improvement**: "Things feel different now" / "Everyone becomes happy"

**AVOID:**
- Mixing individual NPC reactions with collective atmosphere
- Describing physical environmental changes instead of emotional climate
- Creating changes disconnected from the triggering action
- Writing changes too extreme for the action's scope
