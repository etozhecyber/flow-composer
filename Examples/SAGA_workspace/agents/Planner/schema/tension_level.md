Measure dramatic intensity and urgency of current scene to control game pacing and manage player engagement levels. This determines psychological pressure players feel and stakes of their decisions.

**CORE CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Dramatic Intensity**: Current position in story's dramatic arc and level of psychological pressure
- **Pacing Control**: Management of game rhythm, balance between tension and relaxation
- **Player Experience**: Control of immersion and stress levels, adjustment of emotional intensity

**FOUR TENSION LEVELS:**

**"low" - Relaxed Atmosphere:**
- Comfortable situations with no immediate danger or pressure
- Time available for careful thought and planning
- Social, everyday interactions without significant stakes
- Example: "Sitting comfortably by inn's fireplace, leisurely discussing travel plans"

**"building" - Rising Tension:**
- Something significant about to happen with growing unease
- Unclear dangers or opportunities developing
- Situations requiring careful observation and preparation
- Example: "Noticing suspicious figures whispering in tavern corner"

**"high" - Elevated Tension:**
- Clear danger or conflict requiring immediate attention
- Situations where mistakes carry significant consequences
- Moments demanding concentration and quick judgment
- Example: "Guards approaching with suspicious looks while your hand moves toward weapon"

**"climactic" - Peak Tension:**
- Do-or-die moments or ultimate crisis situations
- Everything-at-stake decisive moments
- Irreversible, monumentally important choices
- Example: "Dragon's breath approaches as ally's life hangs in balance of your next action"

**DETERMINING FACTORS:**
- **Risk Degree**: Life threats, goal threats, relationship threats
- **Time Pressure**: Immediate response required, limited time for action
- **Information Uncertainty**: Unknown dangers, incomplete information
- **Stakes Size**: Personal importance, social impact, story significance

**SUCCESS LEVEL IMPACT:**
- **Critical Success**: Can dramatically reduce tension (Climactic → Low)
- **Critical Failure**: Can dramatically increase tension (Low → High, Building → Climactic)
- **Gradual Changes**: Success/Partial Success/Failure create moderate shifts

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- **Balance Maintenance**: Avoid prolonged high tension (fatigue) or extended low tension (boredom)
- **Logical Transitions**: Sudden changes require clear justification; gradual changes feel more natural
- **Context Consideration**: Current story stage, player state, previous scene tension levels

**AVOID:**
- Maintaining climactic tension too long
- Random tension changes without story justification
- Ignoring player emotional state when setting tension
