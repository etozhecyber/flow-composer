**ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES DESCRIPTION GUIDE:**

Define specific physical and sensory alterations to the environment caused by player actions. Focus on measurable, observable changes to physical space rather than emotional atmosphere shifts.

**CORE CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Physical Reality**: Measurable changes perceived through five senses, independent of character emotions
- **Spatial Impact**: Physical condition changes affecting movement, visibility, accessibility, and gameplay mechanics
- **Persistence**: Changes that last for certain duration and modify conditions for subsequent actions

**DISTINCTION FROM OTHER ELEMENTS:**
- **Environmental Changes**: "Lighting dims, noise decreases" (physical)
- **Atmosphere Change**: "Tension increases, trust builds" (psychological)
- **Scene Description**: Complete scene portrayal including environmental changes
- **Side Effects**: Secondary consequences from environmental changes

**MAJOR CATEGORIES:**
- **Lighting Changes**: Brightness, direction, magical illumination
- **Acoustic Changes**: Noise level, sound quality, audio masking
- **Temperature/Air**: Temperature shifts, air quality, air movement
- **Spatial Structure**: Physical obstacles, accessibility, space division
- **Visibility**: Sight range, concealment conditions, visual clarity
- **Sensory Environment**: Olfactory, tactile, combined sensory effects

**SUCCESS LEVEL VARIATIONS:**
- **Critical Success**: Dramatic transformations with ideal conditions created
- **Success**: Expected positive improvements, stable sustainable alterations
- **Partial Success**: Incomplete improvements with some constraints remaining
- **Failure**: No change or results contrary to intention
- **Critical Failure**: Serious deterioration with dangerous conditions created

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- **Specificity**: Clearly express "how" and "how much" with concrete descriptions
- **Gameplay Relevance**: Changes should influence player's next actions and create new opportunities/constraints
- **Sensory Richness**: Include multiple sensory elements for immersion
- **Logic**: Changes must comply with physical laws and maintain cause-and-effect relationships

**QUALITY EXAMPLES:**
- **Effective**: "Magic explosion splits central table in half, window glass vibrates, blue sparks float for 30 seconds. Scattered debris makes quiet movement difficult"
- **Needs Improvement**: "Something changed" / "Everything transformed" / "Mood feels different"

**FORMAT:**
Write as single descriptive statement focusing on most significant physical alterations affecting subsequent gameplay and decision-making.

**AVOID:**
- Mixing emotional/psychological changes with physical alterations
- Creating changes unrelated to triggering action
- Making alterations too extreme for action's scope
- Focusing only on visual changes while ignoring other senses
