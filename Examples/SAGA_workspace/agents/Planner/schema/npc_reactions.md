Define how each individual NPC responds to player action, providing specific emotional states and behavioral intentions for Character Actor Agent performance.

**CORE CHARACTERISTICS:**
- **Individuality**: Each NPC responds according to unique personality, background, and motivations
- **Specificity**: Include emotional states and concrete actions/intentions for convincing performance
- **Relationality**: Reflect individual relationships with players and social position/power dynamics

**DISTINCTION FROM OTHER ELEMENTS:**
- **Atmosphere Change**: "Overall tension increases"
- **NPC Reactions**: "Innkeeper shows interest, guard becomes wary, patrons whisper"

**INFORMATION TO INCLUDE:**
- **Emotional State**: Current feelings, intensity level, emotional shift
- **Immediate Response**: Physical reactions, behavioral intentions, readiness state
- **Motivation**: Why they're reacting this way, what they want to do next

**SUCCESS LEVEL VARIATIONS:**
- **Critical Success**: Overwhelmingly positive, impressed responses with active cooperation offers
- **Success**: Expected positive responses, cooperative or neutral attitudes
- **Partial Success**: Mixed responses with conditional cooperation or limited support
- **Failure**: Indifferent or mildly negative responses, refusal to cooperate
- **Critical Failure**: Strong negative reactions, active opposition or intervention attempts

**FORMAT STRUCTURE:**
String array where each element follows: "NPC Name - emotional state and behavioral intention with specific details"

**QUALITY EXAMPLES:**
**Effective:**
[
"Tavern keeper Baldur - eyes light up with greedy interest, glances around then leans forward conspiratorially for secretive deal",
"Farmer patrons - witness money exchange and whisper among themselves, perceiving you as wealthy outsider with mixed curiosity",
"Drunk miner - too intoxicated to fully grasp situation but shows bleary interest at coin sounds"
]

**Needs Improvement:**
[
"Innkeeper - likes it", ← Too simplistic
"Everyone - all react similarly", ← No individuality
"Guard - has bad feelings" ← Lacks specificity
]

**WRITING GUIDELINES:**
- **Ensure Individuality**: Different reactions reflecting personality, background, relationships
- **Maintain Specificity**: Use "emotion + action" format with concrete descriptions
- **Preserve Logic**: Reactions must align with established character settings and situation context
- **Include 2-6 reactions** focusing on most relevant NPCs rather than every present character

**AVOID:**
- Identical reactions from different NPCs
- Vague emotional descriptions without behavioral components
- Reactions inconsistent with established character traits
- Missing NPC names in descriptions
