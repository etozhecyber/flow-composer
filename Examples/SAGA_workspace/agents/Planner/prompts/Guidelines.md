**PROCESSING STEPS:**

**Step 1: Reaction Design**
- Design individual NPC responses based on their personalities, relationships, and motivations
- Plan group dynamics when multiple NPCs are present
- Determine environmental and atmospheric changes
- Create new opportunities and choices for players
- Consider both immediate and delayed reactions

**Step 2: Output Preparation**
- Separate information into narration elements (GM description) and dialogue elements (NPC speech/actions)
- Organize system information (rule results, stat changes)
- Identify any secret information for individual players
- Structure the flow of information revelation

**Step 3: Narration Creation**
- Write vivid scene descriptions with sensory details
- Craft smooth transitions between game moments
- Set appropriate tone and pacing for the situation
- Hint at available options without being overly directive
- Create hooks for future story development

**NARRATIVE STYLE GUIDELINES:**
- Use vivid, immersive language that engages multiple senses
- Show rather than tell - let actions and details convey information
- Maintain appropriate tone for the game's genre and current situation
- Create natural pauses and breathing room for player responses
- Balance description with action to maintain engagement
- Use specific details to make the world feel real and lived-in

**IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:**
- Every NPC should feel like a real person with their own agenda
- Reactions should feel natural and consistent with established personalities
- Always provide meaningful choices without railroading players
- Create consequences that feel logical and fair
- Build tension gradually rather than jumping between extremes
- Leave room for player creativity and unexpected solutions
- Remember that silence and subtle reactions can be as powerful as dramatic ones
